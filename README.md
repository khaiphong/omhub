# OmHub

OmHub is <b>Kubernetes distributed Datacenter</b> to enable KP-Platform of <b>wholesome applications</b> using Kafka event-driven microservices (Home, PersonaDB, PersonaAI, EIP, CHR, GSLP, etc) to provide required and changing functionalities of a holistic "<b>Persona</b>" "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/awareness.html#Section_1" target="_blank">Awareness, Dependent, Prajna / Kiến Tánh, Duyên Khởi, Bát Nhã</a> for streaming and distributed from user private <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/muhub/" trget="_blank">MuHub</a> with selected GSLP (Global Service Local Presence) / ThankYou Clubs.

Cloud-based distributed <b>OmHub</b> is designed for an efficient Eco System where relevant activities, relationships, and services - securely categorised by networks of group Activities, Relationships, Places and MyIntuition - are injected for you in-part discover and in-part create the Real You. Just like required restrictions to standardise an Open-Container, we suggest three more restrictions to achieve an efficient system: (1) use functional programming with immutable data in all nodes, (2) use ReactJS ecosystem to design UI that you are only responsible for routing within your service, (3) use open-source PersonaDB <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personadb/tree/master/go/pdb/" trget="_blank">Pdb (Private DB)</a> at manageable generations of microservices under your control.

"<b>OmHub</b>" are centralised Authentication and Authorisation centres having indexes of available services, providing pointers to requested service nodes plus System and Custom Actions with required facilities such as internal DNS and private sub-nets to make happened on-line commerce. Services generate Activities and Relationships at Places which are processed and summarised in "OmHub" for Artificial Intelligence <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personaai/" trget="_blank">PersonaAI</a> to custom serve each <b>Persona</b> who can wear different hats using different emails such as user hat, employee hat, social hat. It is also the cloud-based distributed graphs of each user/service private "<b>MuHub</b>" where dynamic interactions of users and services through activities, relationships and places are synchronised to be eventually consistent when pushed from a connected "<b>OmHub</b>".
