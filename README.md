# OmHub

OmHub is <b>Kubernetes distributed Datacenter</b> to enable KP-Platform of <b>wholesome applications</b> using Kafka event-driven microservices (Home, PersonaDB, PersonaAI, EIP, CHR, GSLP, etc) to provide required and changing functionalities of a holistic "<b>Persona</b>" "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/awareness.html#Section_1" target="_blank">Awareness, Dependent, Prajna / Kiến Tánh, Duyên Khởi, Bát Nhã</a> for streaming and distributed from user private <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/muhub/" trget="_blank">MuHub</a> with the distributed Data Centre housing selected GSLP (Global Service Local Presence) / ThankYou Clubs.

Cloud-based distributed <b>OmHub</b> is designed for an efficient Eco System where relevant activities, relationships, and services - securely categorised by networks of group Activities, Relationships, Places and MyIntuition - are injected for you in-part discover and in-part create the Real You. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication" trget="_blank">Mutual authentication / mTLS</a> is the technology for two [ parties / personas ] authenticating each other at the same time in an authentication protocol of Transport Layer Security in value-added services. This enable minimum barrier of entry for your unique service and its "<b>unique sauce</b>" to serve Global Market from Local Service. Typical example of this is <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/empty-content-transcendental-inner-peace.html#Section_3" target="_blank">"#EmptyTheContent" known in Gotama Signed Posts</a> from different religious traditions and cultures, organized and supports by those actually having certified experiences. Just like required restrictions to standardise an Open-Container, we suggest three more restrictions to achieve an efficient system: (1) use functional programming with immutable data in all nodes, (2) use ReactJS ecosystem to design UI that you are only responsible for routing within your service, (3) use open-source PersonaDB <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personadb/tree/master/backend/pdb/" trget="_blank">Pdb (Private DB)</a> at manageable generations of microservices under your control.

"<b>OmHub</b>" are centralised Authentication and Authorisation centres having indexes of available services, providing pointers to requested service nodes plus System and Custom Actions with required facilities such as internal DNS and private sub-nets to make happened on-line commerce. Services generate Activities and Relationships at Places which are processed and summarised in "OmHub" for Artificial Intelligence <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personaai/" trget="_blank">PersonaAI</a> to custom serve each <b>Persona</b> who can wear different hats using different emails such as user hat, employee hat, social hat. It is also the cloud-based distributed graphs of each user/service private "<b>MuHub</b>" where dynamic interactions of users and services through activities, relationships and places are synchronised to be eventually consistent when pushed from a connected "<b>OmHub</b>".
